  I am Abhinandan Saha and I want to study and build my career in Computer Science. I am very inquisitive and I have a hunger for knowledge, to innovate, to learn and I love challenges, I am very hard working and always on the lookout for opportunities to exercise my academic and intellectual abilities. In the world of computers, programming, data scinece, web developent and computer science, as a whole, interests me a lot, as it requires logical thinking, and thinking out of the box, to solve today‚Äôs problems, which creates a base for computer application. I am a firm believer in diversity of thought and disciplines as drivers of progress and I believe that through a  beautiful amalgamation of ideas and different people, does one flourish and contribute impactfully and meaningfully.
  
  Solving problems, doing new things, challenging myself ‚Äì this is what I want. Computer Science holds great value for humanity and has the power to change the world for the good and betterment of all. I want to train myself in this discipline to be of service to humanity and to the greater good. I want to do something impactful and meaningful, and I am certain Computer Science would equip me with the necessary knowledge to do it

- Education:

  - High School: Studied in one of the most prestigious and largest schools of Asia, South Point High School. 
    Scored 91.4% in Standard X, 91.6% in Standard XII(Science), 91.6 percentile in JEE and in the 99th percetile (1500/1600 in SAT).
 
 - Skill building: 
 
   - For the past 4 years, I've had computer science as a high school major and thus have been instructed in it and explored rigorous and advanced concepts and algorithms. I‚Äôve collaborated with peers on multiple projects and have submitted major final projects for every year.
   
   - In the last one year, I have completed, and am on course to completing multiple online course offerings from universities and institutions such as Harvard, IBM, DataCamp, Coursera and MIT, and have completed Professional certifications gain professional skills in a multitude of areas of CS. I have also enrolled myself in online modules to teach myself in-depth concepts of computational thinking and have learnt and mastered five computing languages: Python, Java, C, HTML/JavaScript, and MySQL.
   
   - I believe that practical application and hands on learning serve as the truest gateway to gain core understanding about subjects, and with this vision I have completed 7   projects related to AI and machine learning, created multiple websites to master Web Developement, using javascript, html, css, Django etc. and worked on 9 data science projects and 1 capstone project for SpaceX‚Äôs launch success prediction and analysis. I have learned  about the fundamental concepts of AI and as a part of the coursework for an online course (Harvardx ‚Äì CS50 AI), I have worked on and completed its seven projects and have  implemented worker functions for the proper functioning of the AI in problems pertaining to problems such as, Optimization, Best path solve, PageRank, speech (parser and answering questions), Inference, knowledge etc. 
   
    - I have also participated in IBM's Training network course for professional skill building and gave exams and passed with a grade above 90% on real world problems.
  
- I am honing my skills and am enthusiastic and excited to keep on learning and given a chance I want to get into research and start working on my subject as soon as possible, and become industry-ready and especially future ready.
