# Abhinandan Saha

Industry experience including Distributed Systems, DevOps, Full Stack Development, and Research, I am a very curious and driven individual focused on acquiring knowledge to grow both individually and professionally. I am currently a Data Infrastructure Engineer at the WiNGS Lab in the University of Wisconsin - Madison. I am pursuing a major in Computer Science and minors in Mathematics and Data Science at the University of Wisconsin - Madison. I am also concurrently involved in research efforts to study the applications of Generative Artificial Intelligence in Data Science Education with the Computer Sciences department of the University of Wisconsin - Madison.

I’m interested in opportunities that combine computer science, infrastructure, and research-driven problem solving. I’m especially drawn to work that involves building scalable systems across different layers of the stack and pushes me to keep learning. Curiosity and growth are what motivate me, and I’m eager to contribute to projects where I can make a real impact while deepening my understanding.

Currently completing my education at the Univeristy of Wisconsin - Madison, majoring in Computer Science and minors in Data Science and Mathematics.

## Professional Focus

- **Infrastructure Engineering @ WiNGS Lab**  
  Building distributed systems for spectrum sensing research and applications. Deployed a Kubernetes-based data ingestion pipeline integrating Kafka, Flink, and HDFS, now running in a cost-optimized on-prem cluster.

- **Former Systems Intern @ CHTC**  
  Maintained HTCondor infrastructure across 1000+ nodes. Automated OS upgrades and configurations using Puppet, and supported HPC workloads used by hundreds of research groups.

- **Research in Generative AI**  
  Currently designing prompt pipelines that extract learning objectives and generate personalized project scaffolds from academic material.

- **Past Research in Materials Science**  
  Simulated semiconductor bandgap properties using CDVAEs and neural networks trained on 80GB+ of material datasets.
